   ```

2. **Install** dependencies.

   ```
   yarn
   ```

3. **Run** the app in the development mode.\
   It will open a browser tab with the dev url [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/).

   ```
   yarn start
   ```

4. **Run** the Storybook.\
   It will open a browser tab with the dev url [`http://localhost:6006/`](http://localhost:6006/).

   yarn storybook
   ```

5. **Test** the App.
